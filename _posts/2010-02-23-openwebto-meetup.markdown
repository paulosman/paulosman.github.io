<p>On Tuesday, March 2nd at 7pm, I'll be hosting the first #OpenWebTO Meetup at the Centre for Social Innovation. My goal is to get a group of people interested in open web tech together to present, chat, and share ideas. The first meeting will be focused on figuring out what people want out of such a gathering, and what topics in particular are popular. I'm going to do a quick presentation on how I see the current landscape of open web tech and hopefully get some discussion going. Open web technology is a pretty broad topic, so it's probably helpful to say that I'm thinking specifically of protocols like OpenID, OAuth, Portable Contacts, WebFinger, Webhooks / PubSubHubbub, Activity Streams, and similar. </p>

<p>The more the merrier of course, so if you're in the Toronto area and have an interest in open web technologies, come on out and join us! Details are on <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/14898">Guestlist</a>.</p>
