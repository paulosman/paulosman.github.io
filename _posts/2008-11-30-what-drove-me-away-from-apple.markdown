<p>I recently replaced my Macbook Pro with a Thinkpad x200 running Arch Linux and Windows Vista. After 5 years of using Apple products I decided to switch &ndash; to borrow one of their marketing terms &ndash; because frankly, I was sick of being abused as a customer and the lock-in was making me less and less comfortable. Here's a list of the things that really did it for me:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Pricing the Macbook Air so high with such low specs.</li>
  <li>Releasing an pitiful update to the air along with a nice $100 price increase.</li> 
  <li>Doing away with the matte screen option.</li>
  <li>Pulling the remotes from being included with laptops (admittedly not a huge deal, but felt like salt on a wound).</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it just me or is Apple becoming a little too arrogant? Anyway, I know Lenovo won't be saints either, but at least in the non-Mac OS X world I can easily switch vendors down the road if I ever need to.</p>
