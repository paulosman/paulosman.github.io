<p>I have a tutorial at the <a href="http://devzone.zend.com">Zend Developer Zone</a> called <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/article/4486-Wrapping-C-Classes-in-a-PHP-Extension">Wrapping C++ Classes in a PHP Extension</a>. It walks you through writing a simple PHP extension that wraps a class written in C++. This is a useful thing to be able to do, especially when exposing an already existing library's API to PHP userland scripts, which seems like a fairly common task.</p>
