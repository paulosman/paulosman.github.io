<p>The second #OpenWebTO meetup is happening on Tuesday, April 20th at 7pm. We're at the <a href="http://socialinnovation.ca/">Centre for Social Innovation</a> again but this time on the 1st floor.</p>

<p>For this meetup, James Walker (<a href="http://walkah.net">walkah</a>) is going to be presenting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webfinger/">WebFinger</a> / <a href="http://hueniverse.com/2009/11/the-discovery-protocol-stack-redux/">The Hammer Stack</a>. This will be a fairly in-depth look at the various pieces that make up Hammer Discovery Protocol Stack (XRD, LRDD, /.well-known, etc) and how they fit together. I've spent some time looking at the big picture of this stuff, but have yet to dive into the minutiae, so I'm looking forward to this.</p>

<p>James works for <a href="http://status.net">StatusNet</a> and is one of the authors of the <a href="http://ostatus.org/">OStatus 1.0 Draft</a>.</p>

<p>There's still plenty of space, so if you're interested in discovery, or just want to chat about Open Web stuff, <a href="http://guestlistapp.com/events/18687">sign up on Guestlist</a>. See you there!</p>
