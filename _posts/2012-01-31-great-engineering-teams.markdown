title: Great Engineering Teams
---

Building great teams is hard. We all know this. Nobody has the perfect
recipe for creating a great engineering team, but I'm fairly certain
that some things are obvious and should be heeded. What follows is a
list of observations I've made throughout my career about what seems
to work and what doesn't. Perfect excuse for a good old "Do" and
"Don't" list:

Do: Encourage Side Projects
---------------------------

All good developers run into things that piss them off from time to
time. Great developers build tools that help them fix the shit that
pisses them off. Give developers space and time to work on things not
on the roadmap and they'll probably end up building tools that solve
unseen business problems. Intentionally under-load developers (or go
one step further and do away with deadlines) and you'll start to see
deploys run more smoothly, metrics start being captured, open source
libraries and tools start being published and everyone is happier for
it. Allowing developers time for side projects is an intangible, but
I'm convinced it's an investment that pays for itself and then some.

Don't: Hire Asymmetric Managers
-------------------------------

One of my pet peeves is seeing a shop employ a "manager" who's job is
to pester developers and make sure they meet deadlines. The best
managers I've worked with always ask two questions during check-ins:

1. How are you doing? 
2. What can I do to help you?

Good managers know that their job is to enable people to do great
things by clearing roadblocks and getting the hell out of their
way. If you have a manager who is constantly "whipping" their team
into shape, things are going to go very wrong. Hire managers who help
programmers as much as possible. We're all on the same team.

Do: Support Async Workflows
---------------------------

Being a software developer involves blocking out large chunks of time
to get into periods of deep concentration. Requiring developers to
break for meetings or respond to emails / im messages / impromptu
conversations immediately breaks concentration and can ruin a big part
of the day. It also screws your remote employees if you have
any. [Zach
Holman](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/)
and [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html) have
written about this much more elequently than I could hope to.

Don't: Hire "B"s
----------------

Comprimising on hiring is the quickest way to build a shitty team. It
can be tempting to hire some "juniors" that will need supervision, and
there's definitely room for people with a variety of experience, but
you need to shoot for the best and hire nothing but. Hiring second
rate developers will hurt your productivity and effect the morale of
your best folks. Good people like to work with good people. Don't fuck
with that. 

Do: Encourage a devops culture
------------------------------

As I mentioned, great programmers scratch their own itches. Hire
people who know the whole stack. Great programmers should write great
code, but also care about how it's deployed and write or use tools
that help you do that effectively and safely. Having a divide between
developers and people who make sure their code can be shipped creates
two problems:

1. Your developers stop thinking about ops. 
2. You create an "us" vs "them" attitude. Developers complain about
"conservative" ops people and ops people complain about "sloppy"
developers. 

Bottom line: making sure your production environment is healthy is 
everybodys job.

Conclusion
----------

Most of this boils down to respect. If you're shipping software,
you're an engineering company. Engineering companies need to be
managed as such. Don't treat your developers as second tier. Give them
what they need, support them and your chances of building a great
culture where people want to come and do great work will be greatly
increased.
