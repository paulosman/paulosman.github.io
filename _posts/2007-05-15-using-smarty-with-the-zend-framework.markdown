So it appears that the <a href="http://framework.zend.com">Zend Framework</a> is approaching a 1.0 release, which is very exciting. The last time I worked with the ZF, I found the capabilities of the Zend_View class to be a little bit limited. Luckily, somebody has written a tutorial on using the <a href="http://smarty.php.net">Smarty</a> template engine with the Zend Framework. Read more about it <a href="http://devzone.zend.com/node/view/id/2028">here</a>.
