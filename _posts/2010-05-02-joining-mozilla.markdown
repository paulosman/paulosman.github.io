<p>I'm very happy to announce that I've taken a position as a Senior Web Developer for the Mozilla Foundation. I'm sure I'll be getting into all sorts of things, but job number one is going to be helping out with the <a href="http://drumbeat.org">Drumbeat</a> community. If you've never heard of it, Mozilla Drumbeat is a launch-pad and playground for every day web users working on preserving the openness of the web. It's kick-ass and extremely important and I'm proud to be a part of it.</p>

Deciding to leave FreshBooks was a tough call to make. I worked with some amazing people, and I've been able to build [Some](http://developers.freshbooks.com/blog/view/freshbooks_now_supports_oauth/) [Really](http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2010/03/10/google-apps-marketplace-live-with-freshbooks/) [Cool](http://developers.freshbooks.com/blog/view/on_implementing_webhooks/) [Things](http://www.freshbooks.com/blog/2010/01/19/where-in-the-world-is-freshbooks/). FreshBooks is truly a cool place to work, and I continue to encourage people to check them out. In the end though, the idea of working for a <a href="http://blog.lizardwrangler.com/2010/04/23/lets-speak-up-about-mozillas-public-benefit-status/">public benefit organization</a> was just too good to pass up. Mozilla is an organization that I've always had a profound amount of respect for and I look forward to helping them <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/about/mission.html">promote openness, innovation and opportunity on the web</a>.

<p>I won't be moving (a number of people have asked me this). I'm going to be working out of the Toronto office, which I'm very glad to say has gone through some serious beautification since <a href="http://valleywag.gawker.com/391711/techs-worst-workspace-mozilla">being written about by Valleywag</a>. (No seriously, it's a lot nicer now. There's even an espresso machine!)</p>
