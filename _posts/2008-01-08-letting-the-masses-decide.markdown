<a href="http://kuwamoto.org/">Sho Kuwamoto</a> has been doing some excellent work on implementing improved pluralization support for PHP, Ruby on Rails and AppleScript. When I put together a <a href="/articles/php-pluralize">quick solution</a> for this in PHP, I couldn't help but think that there might be some missing special cases or what have you. Well, Sho has now put together a <a href="http://kuwamoto.org/2008/01/04/mob-intelligence-please-feed-the-pluralizer/">feeder app</a> for the pluralizer. What a neat experiment in collaborative web production! <a href="http://kuwamoto.org/2008/01/04/mob-intelligence-please-feed-the-pluralizer/">Go on and give it a try.</a>
