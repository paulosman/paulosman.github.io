title: Cycling for Cancer Research
---

On June 7th and 8th, I'll be joining the
[Ride to Conquer Cancer](http://www.conquercancer.ca/index.html) &mdash; a
two day ride from Toronto, Ontario to Niagara Falls (that's just over
200km). The ride raises money for the
[Princess Margaret Cancer Centre](http://www.uhn.ca/corporate/AboutUHN/OurHospitals/Pages/pmh.aspx),
one of the top 5 cancer research centres in the world. I'm doing this
because the work done at centres like Princess Margaret has a direct
impact on cancer patients and their loved ones. The ride funds are
directed towards research initiatives that are focused on Personalized
Cancer Medicine improving detection, diagnosis, targetting and
support.

Fundraising
===========

The ride has a $2500 fundraising minimum, and thanks to the
generosity of friends and family, I'm sitting at $340 with a mere
$2160 to go.

__Here's the thing:__ I really hate asking people for money, even when
it is going to such a worthy institution. Instead I've decided to give
things away to people who donate certain amounts. I've been quite busy
as of late, and came to the conclusion that one of the most valuable
things I can give is my time.

About Me
========

I have 15 years of experience working in the tech industry. In that
time I've worked for companies like SoundCloud and Mozilla, and I'm
now the Director of Platform Engineering at 500px (you can see my
[LinkedIn Profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/paulosman) for details).
I have a huge amount of experience writing software and managing teams
of Software Developers with an emphasis on platforms (both internal
and external APIs).

You can use this time to pick my brain about anything related to
technology. If you're new to software or considering getting into the
industry, I'd love to answer your questions or go over your code with
you. If you're starting a product company, I can give you my honest
feedback on your idea. Maybe you just want to bounce ideas off me or
just chat about tech, I'm happy to do that too.

The Perks
=========

* __$30 or more__ $30 will get you a thank you card from me - I know this is paltry, but I appreciate your support so much.
* __$100 or more__ For $100 you'll get the above plus an hour over Skype / Google Hangouts or in person if you're in the Toronto area.
* __$500 or more__ If you want to go nuts, you get a whopping 8 hours of my time for general tech consulting. I'm limiting this to 3 donations and I'll update here once they're gone.

Donate Now
==========

Any amount makes a difference. Cancer is a terrible disease that
effects so many of us. If you want to take advantage of any of the
perks above, simply include details in the Personal Note section when
donating. [Donate Here](http://bndfr.com/Ctp8).
