Hello, my name is Paul Osman. I love building stuff. When I'm not working on software projects, I'm usually cycling or running or thinking about cycling or running.

I live in Toronto with my wife Meghann, [who also spends a lot of time thinking about software](https://unspace.ca/about/). We both love the South and dream of relocating to New Orleans one day.
